Manual testing of the sign up form was done.Sample characters were added to the field for email address.However without @ or '.' characters, I was unable to proceed with the form.
I also did manual testing for all the buttons links in the website and they appeared to be in order.

Browser support

## Responsive design
The use of Bootstrap has helped the responsive design on this webiste.I chose to give three testimonials instead of four on the Customer feedback/testimonial section so as to accomdate a better user experience.
