## Technologies Used


 The technologies used for this project are mainly HTML, CSS , a little bit of JS(Jquery) was used to employ pop up modals and carousels with the help of Bootstrap.

 [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to easily accomadate responsive design, also jquery as part of bootstrap has been used for carousel .

 [Git](https://github.com/) has been used for version control .

 The IDE used for this project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons have also been used in this project for footer content and Features section.
 [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) used for font styles.
 [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to accomdate the css animations for all browsers.
 
 ## Automated testing
 HTML was validated using the [HTML validator ](https://validator.w3.org/).Some errors relating to spacing were identified and fixed.


 CSS was also validated using the [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).However no errors were found.


## Manual testing

Manual testing for responsivness was done using Chrome Developer Tools for different screen sizes.

Sign Up form:
Manual testing of the sign up form was done.Sample characters were added to the field for email address.However without @ or '.' characters, I was unable to proceed with the form.
I also did manual testing for all the buttons links in the website and they appeared to be in order.

Browser support : The website is well supported for Firefox , Microsoft Edge and Chrome.However on Internet explorer, the images under plans section were highly skewed.Tried Auto prefixer option to fix it, but none was available .


## Responsive design
The use of Bootstrap has helped the responsive design on this webiste.I chose to give three testimonials instead of four on the Customer feedback/testimonial section so as to accomdate a better user experience.


## Deployment
The website was deployed by choosing the master branch under the Github pages in the settings option of the project repository.The deployed link can be found at (https://may201.github.io/Farm-To-Home-/)
To run locally, clone repo directly by passing git clone command ,onto the terminal.
